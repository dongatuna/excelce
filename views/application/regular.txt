->On courses page, show how many people have taken our online courses
and how much money has been given.
->On find caregivers page, show how many people have signed up as caregivers.
->On find jobs, display the number of local employers.

Our focus is to connect employers, such as yourself, with qualified caregivers while at the same
time protecting caregivers' contact information.  To that end, Excel CE requires employers to sign in/up
in order to contact and view caregivers' qualifications all the while keeping the contact
information of everyone private.  However, job opening posts are viewable by anyone.

Once you sign in, you can contact caregivers on a 1 -to- 1 basis or you can create a job post and reach 
many caregivers at the same time.  Either way, you contact caregivers using either text/SMS, email
and/or phone call - the most immediate way to notify caregivers of your opening(s). 

In addition, Excel CE has DSHS approved elearning courses that will enable caregivers meet some or all of your certification
requirements.  As you post job openings, you will earn credits you can share with promising caregivers who need extra
certifications to meet your job opening requirements or your caregivers on staff who need to keep their CEUs current.
