->On courses page, show how many people have taken our online courses
and how much money has been given.
->On find caregivers page, show how many people have signed up as caregivers.
->On find jobs, display the number of local employers.

Our focus is to connect employers, such as yourself, with qualified caregivers while at the same
time protecting caregivers' personal information.  To that end, employers need to sign in/up
in order to view caregivers' qualifications.  However, job opening posts are viewable by 
anyone.

Once you sign in, you can contact caregivers on a 1 -to- 1 basis or you can create a job post and reach 
many caregivers at the same time.  Either way, you contact caregivers using either text/SMS, email
and/or phone call - the most immediate way to notify caregivers of your opening(s). 

In addition, Excel CE DSHS approved elearning courses enable caregivers meet some or all of your certification
requirements.  And by doing so, you can get qualified caregiver in front of your client as soon as wisely possible.
